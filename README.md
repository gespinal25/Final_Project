# 2022 NFL Game Prediction Analysis

## Overview of Project
Project group two decided to build a NFL game prediction tool for the upcoming 2022 NFL season. We chose this project because we are all football fans. We have fans of the Eagles, Bills, and the Packers in this group. We can use our prediction tool to see how our teams will fair in the upcoming 2022 season.
  
### Team Roles
Group two overcame a hurdle to get the team roles established. Initially, each team member were able to get the role they desired, however one team member has not been present to agree to the roles. As a group of three, we decided to keep our original roles and then work as a team to cover the fourth role. The roles are as follows:

- Square Role: Gisell. She will ensure the github is update with all necesary files. 
- Triangle Role: Team Effort. As a team, we will complete the machine learning model. 
- Circle Role: James. He will make sure the data is complete and working. 
- X Role: Jesse. He will decide which technologies will be used for the prediction tool.

### Technology Used
For our analysis we will use python and tableau. We will use python to create the code needed for our analysis. We will import the data sets we acquired and display our results using tableau. 

### Communication
Our communication is on slack and zoom. We use class time in break out rooms to hash out what tasks need to be completed for the week. We talk it out as a group to make sure everyone understands our final project and what we would like to accomplish. We use slack outside of class time to communicate with the group. We share ideas and discuss what needs to be completed. We will inform the team when any files are uploaded to github for group review. 
    
### Data Sets
The data sets we have for our analysis are 2022 strength of schedule and team stats dating back to 2002. We will use the overall record for each team during each season to build a trending pattern of wins and losses. We will combine that data with the upcoming seasons strength of schedule and record of opponents to complete our 2022 NFL game predictions. Data sets will be updated and reformated to be read by the technology used.
