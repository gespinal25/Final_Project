# 2022 NFL Game Prediction Analysis

## Overview of Project
For our group project we decided to build an NFL game prediction tool for the upcoming 2022 NFL season. We chose this project because we are all football fans. We are fans of the Eagles, Bills, and the Packers. We can use our prediction tool to see how the outcomes of our teams will fair in the upcoming 2022 season.
  
### Team Roles
Group two overcame a hurdle to get the team roles established. Initially, each team member was able to get the role they desired; however one team member has not been presented to agree to the roles. As a group of three, we decided to keep our original roles and then work as a team to cover the fourth role. The roles are as follows:

- Square Role: Gisell. She will ensure the github is update with all necessary files. 
- Triangle Role: Team Effort. As a team, we will complete the machine learning model. 
- Circle Role: James. He will make sure the data is complete and working. 
- X Role: Jesse. He will decide which technologies will be used for the prediction tool.

### Technology Used
For our analysis we will use python and tableau. We will use python (such as pandas, numby, and Scikit-learn linear regression model) to create the code needed for our analysis. We will import the data sets we acquired and display our results/visuals using tableau.

### Communication
Our base of communication is on Slack and Zoom. We use Zoom during our class time in break-out rooms to regroup, hash out what tasks needs to be completed for the week. We use Slack outside of class time to communicate with the group. For instance, how we use Slack is we share details to make sure everyone understands our final project, answer any questions we might have and what we would like to accomplish. Also, we share ideas and discuss what needs to be completed for the upcoming weeks. In addition, we keep in touch on slack to inform the team when any files are uploaded to github for group review. 
    
### Data Sets
The data sets we have for our analysis are 2022 strength of schedule and team stats dating back to 2002. We will use the overall record for each team during each season to build a trending pattern of wins and losses. We will combine that data with the upcoming seasons strength of schedule, record of opponents, and statistics for QBs, RBs, WRs, and DEF to complete our 2022 NFL game predictions. Data sets will be updated and reformatted to be read by the technology used. All the data sets contain a "Team" column with the abbreviated name for each to in order for the data sets to interact together.
